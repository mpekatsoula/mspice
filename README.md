mspice
======

Mspice is a spice circuit simulator with CUDA support.

Supports the following:

• AC analysis (linear small-signal frequency domain analysis)

• DC analysis (nonlinear quiescent point calculation)

• Transient analysis (time-domain large-signal solution of nonlinear differential algebraic equations)

• Supporting CG and BiCG solvers in CUDA enabled GPUs
